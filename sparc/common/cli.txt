In order to test this component, we need to implement ISelectedChoice in a way
that does not require STDIN/OUT processing.  later, we'll over-write the named
utility 'sparc.common.cli_selected_choice' with our implementation.

    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> from sparc.common.interfaces import ISelectedChoice
    >>> class testSelectedChoice(object):
    ...     implements(ISelectedChoice)
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def selection(cls):
    ...         return '2' # we're A-OK

A named utility is exposed that simplifies the process of retrieving
information from a person executing a command line application.

    >>> import sparc.common
    >>> from sparc.common import Configure
    >>> from sparc.common import ICallable
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> Configure([sparc.common])
    
    Now we need to overwrite the 'sparc.common.cli_selected_choice' utility
    with our test implementation.
    
    >>> from zope.component import getGlobalSiteManager
    >>> gsm = getGlobalSiteManager()
    >>> gsm.unregisterUtility(component=sparc.common.cli.cliSelectedChoice, provided=ISelectedChoice, name=u'sparc.common.cli_selected_choice')
    True
    >>> gsm.registerUtility(testSelectedChoice, ISelectedChoice, u'sparc.common.cli_selected_choice')
    
    Now we can test our utility
    
    >>> asker = getUtility(ICallable, 'sparc.common.ask_question')
    >>> answer = asker(u"How are you?", required = True, answers = [{'1':'awesome'},{'2':'ok'},{'3':'not so good'}], tries = 3)
    How are you?
    (1) awesome
    (2) ok
    (3) not so good
    
    >>> print answer
    2
